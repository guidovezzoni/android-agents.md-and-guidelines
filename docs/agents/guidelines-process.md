# process and workflow guidelines


## Workflow
- After applying the changes, always check lint and tests and fix anything that is reported.

## git related
- CRITICAL: never ever commit directly, always ask confirmation if committing is deemed important
- After implementing a plan, always suggest a commit message summarising the operations performed in such plan. Prepend that suggestion with [Suggested Commit Message]
