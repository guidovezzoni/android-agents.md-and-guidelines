AGENTS.md and guidelines for Android native projects

This repository collects guidelines for guiding agents in their code generation and day-to-day operations with Android code. I will be updating these guidelines while I work with them.

The idea is to begin from the AGENTS.md [agents.md](https://agents.md), which appears to become more popular among different tools.
Its first section provides instructions on how and when to read other set of instructions, depending on which type of code the agent is reading, for instance `guidelines-android.md`.

**Disclaimer 1**: Some of these guidelines might not work as expected or not work at all, depending on tooling and other factors - I am currently testing them with [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai).

Use at your own risk.

**Disclaimer 2**: Some of these guidelines might be debatable, or you mightnot like them, feel free to change them or to let me know your suggestion.
